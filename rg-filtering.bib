  abstract = {A class of exact infinitesimal renormalization group transformations is proposed and studied. These transformations are pure changes of variables (i.e., no integration or elimination of some degrees of freedom is required) such that a saddle point approximation is more accurate, becoming, in some cases asymptotically exact as the transformations are iterated. The formalism provides a simplified and unified approach to several known renormalization groups. It also suggests some new ways in which renormalization group methods might successfully be applied. In particular, an exact gauge covariant renormalization group transformation is constructed. Solutions for a scalar field theory are obtained both as an expansion in \{\textbackslash epsilon\}=4-d and as an expansion in a single coupling constant.},

  abstract = {We describe many new ideas for research in particle flow corresponding to Bayes' rule. Some of these ideas were inspired by quantum field theory and classical electromagnetism whereas others were taken from mathematics or signal processing. For example, we discuss renormalization group flow, Ricci flow, Yang-Mills equations, the Dirac approximation, Kronecker product expansions to estimate the covariance matrix, charge quantization, etc. Three new algorithms for particle flow inspired by renormalization group flow are derived in detail.},

  abstract = {The exact or Wilson renormalization group equations can be formulated as a functional Fokker\textendash Planck equation in the infinite-dimensional configuration space of a field theory, suggesting a stochastic process in the space of couplings. Indeed, the ordinary renormalization group differential equations can be supplemented with noise, making them stochastic Langevin equations. Furthermore, if the renormalization group is a gradient flow, the space of couplings can be endowed with a supersymmetric structure a la Parisi\textendash Sourlas. The formulation of the renormalization group as supersymmetric quantum mechanics is useful for analysing the topology of the space of couplings by means of Morse theory. We present simple examples with one or two couplings.},

  abstract = {The renormalization group has played an important role in the physics of the second half of the twentieth century both as a conceptual and a calculational tool. In particular it provided the key ideas for the construction of a qualitative and quantitative theory of the critical point in phase transitions and started a new era in statistical mechanics. Probability theory lies at the foundation of this branch of physics and the renormalization group has an interesting probabilistic interpretation as it was recognized in the middle seventies. This paper intends to provide a concise introduction to this aspect of the theory of phase transitions which clarifies the deep statistical significance of critical universality.},
